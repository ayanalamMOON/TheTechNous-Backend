# Troubleshooting Guide

This troubleshooting guide provides solutions to common issues that users may encounter while using TheTechNous project.

## Common Issues and Solutions

### 1. Database Connection Error

**Issue**: Unable to connect to the database.

**Solution**:
1. Ensure that the database server is running.
2. Verify the database connection settings in the `.env` file.
3. Check if the database credentials (username, password, host, port) are correct.
4. Ensure that the database user has the necessary privileges to access the database.

### 2. Server Not Starting

**Issue**: The Django development server is not starting.

**Solution**:
1. Check for any syntax errors or missing dependencies in the code.
2. Ensure that the virtual environment is activated.
3. Verify that all required dependencies are installed by running `pip install -r Backend/requirements.txt`.
4. Check the server logs for any error messages and resolve the issues accordingly.

### 3. Static Files Not Loading

**Issue**: Static files (CSS, JavaScript, images) are not loading.

**Solution**:
1. Ensure that the `STATIC_URL` and `STATIC_ROOT` settings are correctly configured in the `settings.py` file.
2. Run the `collectstatic` command to collect all static files:
   ```bash
   python Backend/api/manage.py collectstatic
   ```
3. Verify that the static files are being served correctly by the web server (e.g., Nginx, Apache).

### 4. Celery Worker Not Running

**Issue**: Celery worker is not running or tasks are not being executed.

**Solution**:
1. Ensure that the Celery worker is started by running the following command:
   ```bash
   celery -A api worker --loglevel=info
   ```
2. Verify the Celery configuration settings in the `settings.py` file.
3. Check the Celery worker logs for any error messages and resolve the issues accordingly.
4. Ensure that the message broker (e.g., Redis) is running and accessible.

### 5. Redis Connection Error

**Issue**: Unable to connect to the Redis server.

**Solution**:
1. Ensure that the Redis server is running.
2. Verify the Redis connection settings in the `.env` file.
3. Check if the Redis server is accessible from the application server.
4. Ensure that the Redis server is not running out of memory or experiencing high load.

### 6. Deployment Issues

**Issue**: Issues encountered during deployment to the production environment.

**Solution**:
1. Verify that all environment variables are correctly set in the production environment.
2. Ensure that the web server (e.g., Nginx, Apache) is correctly configured to serve the Django application.
3. Check the server logs for any error messages and resolve the issues accordingly.
4. Ensure that the database and message broker (e.g., Redis) are running and accessible.
5. Verify that the static files are being served correctly by the web server.

### 7. Authentication Issues

**Issue**: Users are unable to log in or access protected resources.

**Solution**:
1. Verify that the JWT token is being correctly generated and included in the Authorization header of API requests.
2. Ensure that the user credentials (username, password) are correct.
3. Check if the user's account is active and not locked or disabled.
4. Verify the JWT token expiration settings and ensure that the token is not expired.

### 8. API Rate Limiting

**Issue**: Users are encountering rate limiting errors when making API requests.

**Solution**:
1. Verify the rate limiting settings in the `settings.py` file.
2. Ensure that the rate limiting configuration is appropriate for the expected usage of the API.
3. Check the server logs for any rate limiting error messages and adjust the settings accordingly.

### 9. Input Validation Errors

**Issue**: Users are encountering input validation errors when submitting forms or API requests.

**Solution**:
1. Verify the input validation settings in the `settings.py` file.
2. Ensure that the input data meets the required criteria (e.g., length, format).
3. Check the server logs for any input validation error messages and resolve the issues accordingly.

### 10. Logging and Monitoring

**Issue**: Issues with logging and monitoring the application.

**Solution**:
1. Verify the logging configuration settings in the `settings.py` file.
2. Ensure that the logging level is set appropriately (e.g., DEBUG, INFO, ERROR).
3. Check the log files for any error messages and resolve the issues accordingly.
4. Set up monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana) to monitor the application's performance and health.
